- 'GREENBELT/RES GRRENBELT/RES' is updated to 'GREENBELT'

### Standardizing SoldAsVacant
Convert:
- 'Y' to 'Yes'
- 'N' to 'No'

### Creating nashville_housing_v1
Transformations Include:
- Removing '.00' from ParcelID.

- Normalizing SoldAsVacant values.
- Splitting OwnerName into two parts where applicable.
- Setting DualOwnerFlag based on the presence of dual owners.

## Data Review
### Volume of Unique Values
