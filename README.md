## Initial Setup
- **Viewing the Original Data**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM nashville_housing_v0;

## Data Cleaning
### Normalizing PropertyAddress
Null values in the PropertyAddress column are filled based on matching ParcelID.
```sql
  WITH PropertyAddress_CTE AS (
    SELECT a.*,
    ISNULL(b.PropertyAddress, a.PropertyAddress) AS NewPropertyAddress
    FROM nashville_housing a
    LEFT JOIN nashville_housing b 
        ON a.ParcelId = b.ParcelId
        AND a.UniqueId <> b.UniqueId
  )
  UPDATE t1
  SET t1.PropertyAddress = t2.NewPropertyAddress
  FROM nashville_housing_v0 t1
  JOIN PropertyAddress_CTE t2
    ON t1.UniqueID = t2.UniqueID;
```

### Standardizing LandUse
- 'VACANT RES LAND' and 'VACANT RESIENTIAL LAND' are changed to 'VACANT RESIDENTIAL LAND'
- 'GREENBELT/RES GRRENBELT/RES' is updated to 'GREENBELT'
``` sql
  WITH LandUse_CTE AS (
    SELECT
    UniqueID,
    CASE 
        WHEN LandUse = 'VACANT RES LAND' THEN 'VACANT RESIDENTIAL LAND'
        WHEN LandUse = 'VACANT RESIENTIAL LAND' THEN 'VACANT RESIDENTIAL LAND'
        WHEN LandUse LIKE 'GREENBELT/RES%GRRENBELT/RES' THEN 'GREENBELT'
        ElSE LandUse
    END AS NewLandUse
    FROM nashville_housing_v0
  )
  UPDATE t1
  SET t1.LandUse = t2.NewLandUse
  FROM nashville_housing_v0 t1
  INNER JOIN LandUse_CTE t2
      ON t1.UniqueID = t2.UniqueID;
```

### Standardizing SoldAsVacant
Convert:
- 'Y' to 'Yes'
- 'N' to 'No'
``` sql
  WITH SoldAsVacant_CTE AS (
    SELECT
    UniqueID,
    CASE
        WHEN SoldAsVacant = 'Y' THEN 'Yes'
        WHEN SoldAsVacant = 'N' THEN 'No'
    ELSE SoldAsVacant
    END AS NewSoldAsVacant
    FROM nashville_housing_v0
  )
  UPDATE t1
  SET t1.SoldAsVacant = t2.NewSoldAsVacant
  FROM nashville_housing_v0 t1
  INNER JOIN SoldAsVacant_CTE t2
      ON t1.UniqueID = t2.UniqueID;
```

## Data Transformation
### Creating nashville_housing_v1
Transformations Include:
- Removing '.00' from ParcelID.
- Extracting street address and city from PropertyAddress.
- Converting SalePrice to an integer.
- Normalizing SoldAsVacant values.
- Splitting OwnerName into two parts where applicable.
- Setting DualOwnerFlag based on the presence of dual owners.
- Parsing OwnerAddress into street address, city, and state.

### Removing Duplicates
Creating nashville_housing_v2:
- Removing duplicates based on ParcelID, SaleDate, SalePrice, and LegalReference.

### Final Cleaned Dataset
Creating nashville_housing_v3:
- Selecting only necessary columns for streamlined analysis.
- 
## Data Review
### Volume of Unique Values
- **Counting unique values in City, OwnerCity, TaxDistrict, and LandUse**:
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT City, COUNT(*) AS Volume
  FROM nashville_housing_v3
  GROUP BY City
  ORDER BY Volume DESC;
